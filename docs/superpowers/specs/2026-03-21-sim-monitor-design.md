# Simulation Monitor — Design Spec

## Overview

A cron-based simulation monitoring tool that watches PBS jobs on the Happiness cluster. It reads a job registry file, checks job health via `qstat` and output file freshness, sends health check pings to healthchecks.io, and notifies the user via email when something goes wrong.

## Goals

- Detect when a simulation job disappears from `qstat` (completed or killed)
- Detect when a running simulation becomes stale (no new output)
- Send periodic health check pings to healthchecks.io (every 5 minutes, 10-minute grace)
- Automatically create new healthchecks via the healthchecks.io Management API
- Maintain a master healthcheck that only receives a success ping when ALL jobs are healthy
- Notify the user via `~/notify.py` when events occur

## Architecture

Cron runs `check.py` every 5 minutes on Hercules. The script is stateless — all persistent state lives in `jobs.json`. Each cycle reads the registry, checks each job, sends pings/notifications, and writes back any updates.

```
┌─────────┐   cron every 5min   ┌──────────┐
│ Hercules │ ──────────────────> │ check.py │
└─────────┘                     └────┬─────┘

                              ┌────────────┐

                              └────────────┘
```

## Job Registry (`jobs.json`)

A JSON array where each entry represents a monitored simulation:

```json
[
  {
    "job_id": "12345.happiness",
    "name": "phys_run_01",
    "output_dir": "/data1/hyeonu/abyss-comoving-test/collapse-test/physical/run_01/",
    "output_pattern": "DD*",
    "stale_timeout": 60,
    "healthcheck_id": null
  }
]
```

### Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `job_id` | string | PBS job ID (e.g., `12345.happiness`) |
| `name` | string | Human-readable label, also used as healthcheck name |
| `output_dir` | string | Absolute path to simulation output directory |
| `output_pattern` | string | Glob pattern for output files/dirs (e.g., `DD*`) |
| `stale_timeout` | int | Minutes without new output before considered stale |
| `healthcheck_id` | string or null | UUID from healthchecks.io, auto-populated on first run |
| `notified_stale` | bool | Whether a stale notification has already been sent (suppresses repeats) |

When `healthcheck_id` is `null`, the monitor creates a new healthcheck via the API and writes the UUID back.

The `notified_stale` flag is set to `true` after the first stale notification email. It is cleared back to `false` when fresh output is detected. This prevents sending a stale email every 5 minutes. Failure pings to healthchecks.io are still sent each cycle regardless.

## Master Healthcheck

A single master healthcheck monitors whether the monitor itself is running. It is stored in `.env` as `MASTER_HEALTHCHECK_ID`. If this key is absent or empty, the monitor creates a new master healthcheck named `"sim-monitor-master"` on the first run and writes the UUID back to `.env`.

The master healthcheck receives a success ping at the end of every successful cycle. If `check.py` encounters an unhandled error (e.g., can't read `jobs.json`, can't parse `.env`), it sends a failure ping to the master before exiting. If the script never runs at all (cron breaks, Hercules goes down), the master misses pings and healthchecks.io alerts you via the grace period.

## Monitor Logic (`check.py`)

Each cron cycle:

1. Read `.env` for `HEALTHCHECK_API_KEY` and `MASTER_HEALTHCHECK_ID` (manual line parsing, no external dependency needed — format is `KEY=VALUE` per line)
2. If `MASTER_HEALTHCHECK_ID` is absent or empty, create the master healthcheck via the API (name=`"sim-monitor-master"`, timeout=300, grace=600) and write UUID back to `.env`
3. Read `jobs.json`
4. For each job:
   - **Healthcheck creation:** If `healthcheck_id` is `null`, create a new check via `POST https://healthchecks.io/api/v3/checks/` with `timeout=300` (5 min), `grace=600` (10 min), and `name` from the job entry. Write the returned UUID back.
   - **Query PBS:** Run `ssh happiness qstat -f <job_id>` to get job state. A non-zero exit code means the job has left the queue ("Disappeared"). Parse `job_state` from the output. States `H` (held), `E` (exiting), `S` (suspended), `W` (waiting), `T` (moving) are treated the same as `Q` (send success ping, no staleness check).
   - **Evaluate state** (see state matrix below).
5. Write updated `jobs.json`
6. Send success ping to master healthcheck (confirms the monitor itself ran successfully).

The entire main loop is wrapped in a try/except. If an unhandled exception occurs, send a failure ping to the master healthcheck (with the error message in the request body) before re-raising.

### State Matrix

| qstat state | Output fresh? | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Running (R) | Yes | Send success ping to healthchecks.io; clear `notified_stale` to false |
| Running (R) | Stale (mtime > stale_timeout) | Send failure ping; send stale email only if `notified_stale` is false, then set it to true |
| Queued (Q) | N/A | Send success ping (waiting is normal) |
| Disappeared | `SUCCESS` marker exists | Remove from `jobs.json` first, then send success ping + completed email |
| Disappeared | No `SUCCESS` marker | Remove from `jobs.json` first, then send failure ping + killed/crashed email |

### Staleness Detection

1. Glob `output_dir/output_pattern`
2. Find the most recently modified match (by mtime)
3. If `now - mtime > stale_timeout` minutes, the job is stale

### Healthchecks.io Integration

- **Create check:** `POST https://healthchecks.io/api/v3/checks/` with headers `X-Api-Key: <key>` and `Content-Type: application/json`, body `{"name": "<name>", "timeout": 300, "grace": 600}`
- **Success ping:** `GET https://hc-ping.com/<healthcheck_id>`
- **Failure ping:** `GET https://hc-ping.com/<healthcheck_id>/fail`
- All HTTP requests use a 10-second timeout to prevent hanging.

### Notifications via `~/notify.py`

- **Stale job:** `python ~/notify.py -s "Job <name> stale" -m "<details>"`
- **Job completed:** `python ~/notify.py -s "Job <name> completed" -m "<details>"`
- **Job killed/crashed:** `python ~/notify.py -s "Job <name> killed/crashed" -m "<details>"`

## Helper CLI (`add_job.py`)

Convenience script to add jobs to the registry:

```bash
python ~/sim-monitor/add_job.py \
  --job 12345.happiness \
  --name phys_run_01 \
  --output-dir /data1/hyeonu/.../run_01/ \
  --output-pattern "DD*" \
  --stale-timeout 60
```

Appends a new entry to `jobs.json` with `healthcheck_id: null` and `notified_stale: false`. Also supports `--remove <name>` to manually remove a job from `jobs.json` (the healthchecks.io check is left as-is; it will auto-pause after missing pings).

## SUCCESS Marker Convention

PBS job scripts should write a `SUCCESS` file at the end of a successful run:

```bash
# Last line of the simulation run script
touch $OUTPUT_DIR/SUCCESS
```

The monitor checks for `output_dir/SUCCESS` when a job disappears from `qstat`.

## File Layout

```
~/sim-monitor/
├── .env                # HEALTHCHECK_API_KEY=... and MASTER_HEALTHCHECK_ID=...
├── jobs.json           # Job registry (auto-managed)
├── check.py            # Main monitor script (cron runs this)

## Cron Entry

```
*/5 * * * * /home/hyeonu/anaconda3/envs/claude/bin/python /home/hyeonu/sim-monitor/check.py >> /home/hyeonu/sim-monitor/check.log 2>&1
```

Runs on Hercules every 5 minutes. Uses the `claude` conda environment for dependencies (requests).

## Error Handling

- If `ssh happiness qstat` fails (network issue), skip the job for this cycle and log the error. Do not send per-job failure ping (transient issue, not a job failure). Send failure ping to the master healthcheck (the monitor cannot do its job if SSH is broken).
- If healthchecks.io API call fails, log the error and continue. The missed ping will trigger healthchecks.io's own grace period alerting.
- If `jobs.json` is empty, exit cleanly.
- File locking on `jobs.json` via `fcntl.flock()` with `LOCK_EX` on a sidecar `.jobs.json.lock` file, held for the entire read-modify-write cycle. Both `check.py` and `add_job.py` use this lock.
- `notify.py` calls `sys.exit(1)` on email failure. The monitor catches `subprocess` non-zero exits from `notify.py` and logs the error without aborting the cycle for remaining jobs.

## Dependencies

- Python 3 (claude conda env)
- `requests` library (for healthchecks.io API)
- SSH access to Happiness (already configured)
- `~/notify.py` (already exists)
